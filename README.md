# MsCalendar

The MsCalendar extension enables users to insert calendars into wiki pages.

## Installation

To install MsCalendar, add the following to your LocalSettings.php:

wfLoadExtension( 'MsCalendar' );

Then run the update script to create the necessary tables (see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Update.php).

## Usage

To insert a calendar into a wiki page, simply edit a page and add the following wikitext:

<MsCalendar>Name of the calendar</MsCalendar>

You can insert as many calendars as you want, but each must have a unique name.

## Configuration

The events of each day are sorted alphabetically. You can also sort them by id by doing:

<MsCalendar sort="id">Name of the calendar</MsCalendar>
